# Module-Project

I'm a uni student and recently had to choose my modules for next year. Unfortunately these are spread across several websites, in different formats.
It's also hard to ascertain what pre-requisites are required for a certain module and what modules a chosen module allows you to to take in the future.

I decided to try and build a programme that allows students to look at modules from all science departments in one place, including this important information and
links to the module webpages.

The project is ongoing, as so far I've only scraped the Physics modules and have yet to decide how I'm going to transform this into a simple UI.
